# laterjs

A small but fast queue system for JS. I don't know why you'd need or want one, but there it is!

# functions

- get - return the queue.
- reset - reset the queue.
- add - add something to queue.
- multi - adds multiple things to queue, as an array.
- run - execute and reset queue, or execute index of queue and reset that index.
